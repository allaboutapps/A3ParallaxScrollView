**A3ParallaxScrollView** is a `UIScrollView` subclass with a parallax scrolling effect on iPhone and iPad.  

It is written in *Objective-C* and works for all iOS applications using ARC.

## Video:
Here are two examples of the use of **A3ParallaxScrollView**.  
The first is a little Demo with a lot of views and additional custom transformations (sine movement of the moon).  
The other one shows a *Path* like scrolling behaviour.
